# B4-10 — Diagnose delta channels beta from execution evidence

Type: trace. Difficulty: medium. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

Beta DeltaChannel stores incremental writes and reconstructs channel state through a deterministic batch reducer. snapshot_frequency bounds how often a full snapshot is written. The reducer must be invariant to regrouping write batches, because replay may batch differently from live execution. Schema and reducer changes require migration testing before reusing old threads.

## Your task

Diagnose delta channels beta from execution evidence Inspect trace.json before reading trace.py. The node updates are captured locally from execution, with superstep labels where available; siblings can finish in either order. Approval pauses, parent-graph handoffs, and cancellation are labeled separately from execution failures. If no node update was observed, use the recorded result and program to locate a pre-execution rejection or a plain-Python/child-process fault. Explain the first broken contract and how it causes the observed result.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "notes": [
      "intake",
      "policy",
      "estimate"
    ],
    "snapshot_frequency": 2
  },
  {
    "notes": [
      "intake",
      "policy",
      "estimate"
    ],
    "snapshot_frequency": 1
  }
]
```

Choose the cause supported by the trace. Set `cause` to exactly one of these descriptions, and preserve the listed observation order:

- "Retain earlier delta writes when applying a new batch."
- "Honor and validate the requested snapshot cadence."
- "Checkpoint every supplied note before reconstruction."
- "Start each reducer batch from the reconstructed accumulated value."

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
