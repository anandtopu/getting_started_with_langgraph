# Worked design review

Per-call HumanInTheLoopMiddleware emits one approval request for each gated tool call. Its response_schema describes only permitted decisions; the runtime validates the answer before saving it. Resume by interrupt ID and keep tool editing disabled when the reviewer may approve or reject only. Typed approval validates shape, while real authorization still belongs to the application.

- granularity: choose per_tool_call; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- validation: choose response_schema; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- decisions: choose approve_or_reject; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.

Rejected alternative: combine all decisions in an unvalidated, mutable global state. It hides ownership and makes independent failure checks harder. Validate normal, boundary, and rejected cases; retain the original synthetic input for comparison. This reference earns full marks only when those checks and the written rationale are both present.
