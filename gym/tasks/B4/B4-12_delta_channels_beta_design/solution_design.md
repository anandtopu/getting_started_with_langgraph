# Worked design review

Beta DeltaChannel stores incremental writes and reconstructs channel state through a deterministic batch reducer. snapshot_frequency bounds how often a full snapshot is written. The reducer must be invariant to regrouping write batches, because replay may batch differently from live execution. Schema and reducer changes require migration testing before reusing old threads.

- status: choose Beta; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- reducer: choose batch_invariant; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- migration: choose replay_test_old_threads; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.

Rejected alternative: combine all decisions in an unvalidated, mutable global state. It hides ownership and makes independent failure checks harder. Validate normal, boundary, and rejected cases; retain the original synthetic input for comparison. This reference earns full marks only when those checks and the written rationale are both present.
