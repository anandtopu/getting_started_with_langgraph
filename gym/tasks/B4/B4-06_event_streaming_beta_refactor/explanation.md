# Why the refactor works

Beta v3 event streaming exposes typed message, subgraph, value, and output projections. Child messages belong to the subgraph projection. The raw protocol uses method and params rather than the v2 type/ns/data shape. This example uses a fresh fake run for raw-event inspection so consuming one view does not pretend to replay already-consumed events.

Separate input preparation from orchestration in prepare_case(case). Preserve all results/errors, distinguish None from {}, and copy nested inputs so caller data and shared defaults stay independent.

The starter is a working behavioral baseline. The reference changes its design, then runs the same case fixtures and a separate structural check. Inspect both test groups: matching one happy-path output does not prove equivalence. Preserve rejection/error behavior and input ownership as well as successful results.

Run the selected workspace file through gym check. Viewing the reference is recorded as assisted study.
