# 15-06 — Refactor entrypoints tasks: Reject booleans even though Python considers them integer instances.

Type: refactor. Difficulty: hard. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

An entrypoint accepts one serializable input and uses ordinary Python branches. A task call schedules durable work and returns a future; result() obtains its value. This supports familiar control flow without removing the need for validated inputs and deterministic replay order.

## Your task

Reject booleans even though Python considers them integer instances. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": 100000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": " ",
    "amount_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": true
  }
]
```

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
