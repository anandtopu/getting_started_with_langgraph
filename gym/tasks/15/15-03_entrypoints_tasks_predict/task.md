# 15-03 — Predict entrypoints tasks across the declared cases

Type: predict. Difficulty: easy. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

An entrypoint accepts one serializable input and uses ordinary Python branches. A task call schedules durable work and returns a future; result() obtains its value. This supports familiar control flow without removing the need for validated inputs and deterministic replay order.

## Your task

Predict entrypoints tasks across the declared cases Predict each result before running the example. Keep the observations in the listed input order.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": 100000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": " ",
    "amount_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "description": "  Pipe burst  ",
    "amount_cents": true
  }
]
```

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
