# 03-10 — Trace command routes: A competing static edge schedules an extra acknowledgment.

Type: trace. Difficulty: medium. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

Command combines state updates with a routing instruction. Its destination annotation helps describe possible edges. A static edge still runs even when a Command chooses another node, so use one routing mechanism at a decision point.

## Your task

A competing static edge schedules an extra acknowledgment. Read trace.py before completing the answer JSON. Explain the first incorrect transition, not just the final symptom.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "suspicious": true
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "suspicious": false
  }
]
```

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
