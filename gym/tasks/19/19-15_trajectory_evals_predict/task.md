# 19-15 — Predict trajectory evals across the declared cases

Type: predict. Difficulty: easy. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

A trajectory is the sequence of tool requests, separate from the final answer. agentevals can compare strict order, unordered calls, subsets, or supersets. Exact argument matching catches the right tool used on the wrong policy. Choose the matching rule from the business requirement; parallel independent calls may legitimately change order.

## Your task

Predict trajectory evals across the declared cases Predict each result before running the example. Keep the observations in the listed input order.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "tools": [
      "lookup_policy",
      "check_coverage"
    ],
    "mode": "strict",
    "policy_id": "POL-0001"
  },
  {
    "tools": [
      "check_coverage",
      "lookup_policy"
    ],
    "mode": "strict",
    "policy_id": "POL-0001"
  },
  {
    "tools": [
      "check_coverage",
      "lookup_policy"
    ],
    "mode": "unordered",
    "policy_id": "POL-0001"
  },
  {
    "tools": [
      "lookup_policy",
      "check_coverage"
    ],
    "mode": "strict",
    "policy_id": "POL-0002"
  }
]
```

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
