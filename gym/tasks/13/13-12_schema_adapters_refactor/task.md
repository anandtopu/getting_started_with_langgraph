# 13-12 — Refactor schema adapters: Separate input preparation from orchestration in prepare_case(case). Preserve all results/errors, distinguish None from {}, and copy nested inputs so caller data and shared defaults stay independent.

Type: refactor. Difficulty: hard. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

When parent and child schemas differ, call the child inside an adapter node. Map the input fields explicitly, then return only the public finding. Private child fields should not become parent state just because a dictionary is convenient to copy.

## Your task

Separate input preparation from orchestration in prepare_case(case). Preserve all results/errors, distinguish None from {}, and copy nested inputs so caller data and shared defaults stay independent. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "amount_cents": 600000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "amount_cents": 500000
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0200",
    "amount_cents": 10000
  }
]
```

The starter already satisfies the original behavior cases. It fails the separate structural requirement. Keep those original tests green while changing the design; a renamed function alone does not establish the required boundary.

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
