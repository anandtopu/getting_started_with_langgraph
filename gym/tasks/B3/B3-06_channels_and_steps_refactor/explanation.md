# Why the refactor works

The educational runner snapshots state before a superstep, collects writes from every sibling, then applies them at a barrier. Thus both workers see zero prior findings while the next-step summary sees both. This small runner explains visibility; it deliberately omits production concurrency, async execution, pending-write recovery, and serialization.

Separate input preparation from orchestration in prepare_case(case). Preserve all results/errors, distinguish None from {}, and copy nested inputs so caller data and shared defaults stay independent.

The starter is a working behavioral baseline. The reference changes its design, then runs the same case fixtures and a separate structural check. Inspect both test groups: matching one happy-path output does not prove equivalence. Preserve rejection/error behavior and input ownership as well as successful results.

Run the selected workspace file through gym check. Viewing the reference is recorded as assisted study.
