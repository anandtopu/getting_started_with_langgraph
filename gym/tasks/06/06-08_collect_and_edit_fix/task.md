# 06-08 — Fix collect and edit: Each interrupt must receive the response for its own request kind.

Type: fix. Difficulty: medium. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

Parallel pauses can be answered with an interrupt-ID-to-response map. IDs identify requests; list order does not. Validate each edited value against its own schema and business limit before merging it into state.

## Your task

Each interrupt must receive the response for its own request kind. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "loss_date": "2026-01-01",
    "approved_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "loss_date": "2026-01-01",
    "approved_cents": 0
  },
  {
    "loss_date": "2026-01-01",
    "approved_cents": 500001
  },
  {
    "loss_date": "invalid",
    "approved_cents": 125000
  },
  {
    "loss_date": "2026-01-01",
    "approved_cents": true
  }
]
```

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
