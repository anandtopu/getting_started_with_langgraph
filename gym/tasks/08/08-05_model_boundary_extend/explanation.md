# Why the solution works

A model predicts text from messages; a prompt is its instruction and evidence. Structured output parses that text into a validated schema. Validation can reject an impossible amount, but cannot prove a claim is true. The deterministic router owns the decision after extraction.

Add run_batch(cases) to preview independent claims in input order. Preserve run(case), isolate mutable inputs, return value/error records, handle an empty batch, and continue after a rejected claim. The implementation preserves the claim identity and separates the tested concern from unrelated state. The cases include normal and boundary inputs, so replacing the result with a single constant is not a general repair.

The deliberate fault changes 'the new node or boundary contract described above' to 'the deliberately incomplete extension'. Follow the data affected by that operation before inspecting later nodes. For predictions, distinguish returned values from error types. For traces, the observed failure is evidence of the first broken contract, not proof that the framework is unreliable.

Run the task tests against your selected workspace file. Viewing this reference is assisted study; a written Design rationale still requires the rubric.
