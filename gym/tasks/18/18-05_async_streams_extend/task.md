# 18-05 — Extend async streams: Cancel and await the pending async graph when requested.

Type: extend. Difficulty: hard. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

ainvoke awaits one result; astream yields intermediate parts. Pass RunnableConfig into async model calls for explicit context propagation. The seven v2 modes expose different views, so count types rather than assuming one common payload. Cancellation must await cleanup; a browser disconnect is not proof that an external effect was rolled back.

## Your task

Cancel and await the pending async graph when requested. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Your estimate is ready.",
    "cancel": true
  },
  {
    "text": "Documents ready.",
    "cancel": false
  }
]
```

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
