# 14-10 — Trace handoffs: Pair the handoff acknowledgment with its AI request.

Type: trace. Difficulty: medium. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

Command.PARENT transfers control from a child graph to a node in its parent. The shared messages channel uses add_messages. A tool-based handoff includes both the AI request and its ToolMessage acknowledgment so the next specialist receives a valid conversation. Parent destinations must not be declared as local child nodes.

## Your task

Pair the handoff acknowledgment with its AI request. Read trace.py before completing the answer JSON. Explain the first incorrect transition, not just the final symptom.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0001",
    "question": "Explain the deductible."
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-0400",
    "question": "What is the water deductible?"
  }
]
```

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
