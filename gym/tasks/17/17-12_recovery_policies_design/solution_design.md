# Worked design review

RetryPolicy repeats selected transient failures; TimeoutPolicy bounds asynchronous attempts. After retries are exhausted, a NodeError-aware handler routes to manual review. RunControl requests a cooperative drain after the current superstep, preserving a resumable boundary rather than killing in-flight work. Recovery must not invent a successful external effect.

- retries: choose transient_only; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- timeout: choose async_attempt; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- shutdown: choose cooperative_drain; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.

Rejected alternative: combine all decisions in an unvalidated, mutable global state. It hides ownership and makes independent failure checks harder. Validate normal, boundary, and rejected cases; retain the original synthetic input for comparison. This reference earns full marks only when those checks and the written rationale are both present.
