# Why the refactor works

TypedDict describes a dictionary for type checking; it does not validate values at runtime. Dataclasses give attribute access and defaults. Pydantic checks fields at the boundary. With explicit v2 output, preserve the schema's object type before extracting its fields.

Separate input preparation from orchestration in prepare_case(case). Preserve all results/errors, distinguish None from {}, and copy nested inputs so caller data and shared defaults stay independent.

The starter is a working behavioral baseline. The reference changes its design, then runs the same case fixtures and a separate structural check. Inspect both test groups: matching one happy-path output does not prove equivalence. Preserve rejection/error behavior and input ownership as well as successful results.

Run the selected workspace file through gym check. Viewing the reference is recorded as assisted study.
