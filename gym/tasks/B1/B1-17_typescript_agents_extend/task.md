# B1-17 — Extend typescript agents: Add run_batch(cases) to preview independent claims in input order. Preserve run(case), isolate mutable inputs, return value/error records, handle an empty batch, and continue after a rejected claim.

Type: extend. Difficulty: hard. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

The TypeScript model factory returns a scripted LangChain fake with tool calls. A manual StateGraph loop and createAgent consume the same trajectory, making their roles and call identities directly comparable. The Python gym bridge executes the selected TypeScript file in Node; it never supplies the business answer itself.

## Your task

Add run_batch(cases) to preview independent claims in input order. Preserve run(case), isolate mutable inputs, return value/error records, handle an empty batch, and continue after a rejected claim. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "policy_id": "POL-0001",
    "recursion_limit": 12
  },
  {
    "policy_id": "POL-0001",
    "recursion_limit": 1
  },
  {
    "policy_id": "MISSING",
    "recursion_limit": 12
  }
]
```

The new capability is checked in addition to the original cases. For run_batch, edit the Python orchestration interface (including in the TypeScript bonus); leave run(case) behavior intact. A batch is sequential and each case owns a new workflow invocation, not a shared durable thread.

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.
