# 10-02 — Fix create agent: Reject unknown policy IDs, not the known fixture.

Type: fix. Difficulty: medium. No live model, key, or network is required.

## The claim scenario

create_agent builds a standard model/tool loop on LangGraph. Start there for ordinary tool use; use a custom StateGraph when the business process requires explicit gates or branches. The compiled agent still accepts state, can be inspected as a graph, and emits normal messages.

## Your task

Reject unknown policy IDs, not the known fixture. Preserve run(case) and the existing public functions. Return a JSON-compatible result. Do not import the reference solution or hard-code one fixture.

## Inputs and acceptance

```json
[
  {
    "policy_id": "POL-0001"
  },
  {
    "policy_id": "MISSING"
  }
]
```

cases.json declares the expected output or expected exception type for every input. Exceptions are observed by the grader; import errors are setup failures. The starter's demo prints a known runtime error when appropriate, so you can inspect it without losing the exercise context.

The suite checks more than the default claim. Keep identities, boundary behavior, and isolation intact. A Design pass includes a separate self-review and is not an automatic architecture-quality judgment.

## Commands

```text
uv run gym start 10-02
