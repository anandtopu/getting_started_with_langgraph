# Worked design review

Middleware hooks surround agent operations. before_model can update declared middleware state; wrap_model_call controls the handler; after_model observes the result. Model and tool budgets are separate: limiting one does not automatically limit the other. Hook order belongs in an explicit test.

- budgets: choose model_and_tool; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- hooks: choose ordered; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.
- state: choose declared_schema; this preserves the boundary exercised by the example.

Rejected alternative: combine all decisions in an unvalidated, mutable global state. It hides ownership and makes independent failure checks harder. Validate normal, boundary, and rejected cases; retain the original synthetic input for comparison. This reference earns full marks only when those checks and the written rationale are both present.
